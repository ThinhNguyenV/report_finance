# Marketing Data Analysis & ETL Pipeline - Q3/2020

This project provides an end-to-end solution for processing, standardizing, and analyzing Marketing, Sales, and Shipping data for the third quarter of 2020. It transforms inconsistent raw data into a structured format and visualizes it through an advanced Power BI dashboard for executive decision-making.

## 📋 Data Processing Pipeline

The raw database (Q3/2020) contained significant formatting and consistency issues that required technical intervention before analysis.

### 1. Key Data Issues & Technical Solutions
| ID | Issue | Cause & Impact | Technical Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Sales Data Loss** | Null values in "Call Date" caused data loss during Q3 filtering. | Switched filtering logic to `lead_date` to retain 100% of generated leads. |
| **2** | **Year Error** | "Close Date" contained 2023 entries instead of 2020. | Implemented `fix_year_logic` to automatically map dates back to the reporting period. |
| **3** | **Naming/Encoding** | Column names contained Vietnamese accents and special characters. | Used **Regex** to strip accents and standardize names for query compatibility. |
| **4** | **Data Typing** | Currency and quantity columns contained non-numeric text strings. | Applied **Type Casting** with error handling, defaulting gaps to 0. |
| **5** | **Order Status** | Success metrics were scattered across "Status" and "Level" columns. | Created an `is_successful` flag for entries marked "dat hang" or "Level 8". |

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Structure

The `Q3.pbix` file contains a multi-page interactive report designed to track the entire customer journey from lead generation to shipping.

### 1. Marketing Performance (MKT)
Focuses on ROI and top-of-funnel efficiency:
* **Revenue Trend Development:** Time-series analysis of marketing spend vs. income.
* **Conversion Funnel Analysis:** Visualization of the journey from Impression to Lead to Order.
* **Campaign Optimization Matrix:** Scatter analysis to identify high-ROAS vs. high-cost campaigns.
* **Marketer Efficiency:** Comparison of cost-per-lead and revenue generated by individual team members.

### 2. Sales Intelligence (SALES)
Deep dive into sales team productivity and lead distribution:
* **Sales Pipeline Funnel:** Detailed view of lead progression through different levels.
* **Sales Representative Leaderboard:** Performance ranking based on conversion rates and revenue.
* **Geographic Distribution:** Lead segmentation by province and top cities using interactive maps.
* **Productivity Analysis:** Correlation between the volume of calls/leads and successful closures.

### 3. Logistics & Shipping (VẬN ĐƠN)
Monitoring order fulfillment and shipping efficiency:
* **Shipment Volume Trends:** Daily monitoring of outgoing packages and delivery status.
* **Shipping Status Distribution:** Breakdown of successful deliveries vs. returned/canceled orders.
* **Carrier Performance:** Correlation analysis between shipping costs, weight, and delivery partners.
* **Regional Logistics:** Analysis of shipment distribution across different geographic regions.

## 🚀 Strategic Roadmap for Q4/2020

* **Technical Audit:** Re-configure GTM and Pixel tracking to ensure 100% visibility on Top-Funnel metrics.
* **Budget Optimization:** Shift spending toward high-ROAS channels (e.g., **Google/PerMax**).
* **Sales Training:** Address zero-conversion issues in "FB/Mess" leads through targeted sales process refinement.
* **CPA Control:** Implement hard budget caps on campaigns exceeding target cost-per-acquisition thresholds.
